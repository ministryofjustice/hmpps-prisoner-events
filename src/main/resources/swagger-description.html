<h4>Prison specific events - <b>offender-events</b> topic</h4>


TODO: add appinsights query to get list of events


<div>
    <p>
      Meta data about the event included as a SQS Message Attribute is as follows:
      <ul>
        <li><b>eventType</b> see below for all event types - this is also included in the message</li>
        <li><b>code</b> optional code that represents either the Alert Code for alerts of the movement Type with direction for events that contain movements</li>
        <li><b>publishedAt</b> the zoned timestamp when this events was published e.g 2020-12-04T10:42:43+01:00, 2020-12-04T10:42:43Z</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
</div>

<h3>Topic subscription</h3>
<p>Clients are expected to use a SQS AWS queue to receive events with queue subscribed to <b>prison-events-topic</b> or <b>hmpps-domain-topic</b> or both. </p>
<p>Clients can subscribe to one or more events. A typical subscription could be:</p>
<pre>
    resource "aws_sns_topic_subscription" "my_probation_subscription" {
    provider      = aws.london
    topic_arn     = module.hmpps-domain-events.topic_arn
    protocol      = "sqs"
    endpoint      = module.my_queue.sqs_arn
    filter_policy = "{\"eventType\":[ \"prison-offender-events.prisoner.released\", \"prison-offender-events.prisoner.receive\", \"prison-offender-events.prisoner.merged\"] }"
    }
</pre>
<p>and this would be defined in the Cloud Platform offender-events namespace for <b>offender_events</b></p>
